# Titanic Survival Prediction Web Application

This Flask web application predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and other features.

## Overview

The application consists of two main functionalities:

1. **Prediction**: Users can input passenger details (age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.) through a web form and get predictions on whether the passenger would survive or not.

2. **Display CSV Data**: Users can view a subset of the Titanic dataset.

## Prerequisites

```bash
#create an env

#install requirements
